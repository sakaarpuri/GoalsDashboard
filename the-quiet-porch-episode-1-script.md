### COLD OPEN

**[0:00 - 0:08]**

**FADE IN FROM BLACK**

---

#### SCENE 1 - THE PORCH (MORNING)

---

**[0:08 - 0:28]** 
**SHOT 1A - WIDE ESTABLISHING (20 seconds)**

**EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DESERT - DAY**

Endless desert. Dust. Heat shimmers. A small wooden house sits alone, porch facing the void. The Man sits in a rocking chair, barely moving. His hat casts a shadow over his eyes. Beside him, in the dirt, lies The Donkey.

**SOUND:** Wind constant. Chair creaks rhythmically. Distant, lonely harmonica note.

**[No dialogue. Just the sound of existence.]**

---

**[0:28 - 0:42]**
**SHOT 1B - MID SHOT: THE DONKEY TURNS (14 seconds)**

The Donkey shifts, rolls onto his side, looks at The Man. Slow blink.

**THE DONKEY (V.O.)**
Nice day.

**SOUND:** Sand shifts as Donkey moves. Chair continues creaking.

The Man says nothing. Rocks once. Creak.

---

**[0:42 - 0:55]**
**SHOT 1C - CLOSE-UP: THE MAN (13 seconds)**

His face, weathered and impassive. Eyes hidden under hat brim. A fly lands on his cheek. He doesn't blink.

**THE DONKEY (V.O.)**
Real nice.

**SOUND:** Fly buzzes. Wind.

**THE DONKEY (V.O.)**
Not too hot. Not too cold. Just... nice.

The Man's eye twitches, almost imperceptibly.

**SOUND:** Harmonica note returns, slightly off-key.

---

#### SCENE 2 - THE MUG

---

**[0:55 - 1:08]**
**SHOT 2A - WIDE: THE DONKEY STANDS (13 seconds)**

The Donkey stands, stretches his back legs one at a time. Yawns. The Man hasn't moved.

**SOUND:** Donkey hooves on wood. Stretching sound (low groan).

---

**[1:08 - 1:32]**
**SHOT 2B - MID SHOT: THE MUG (24 seconds)**

The Man holds a ceramic mug. It's been full for an hour. Steam stopped rising long ago.

**THE DONKEY (O.S.)**
You gonna drink that coffee?

*Long pause. Wind.*

**THE MAN**
*(eventually, dry)*
It's tea.

**SOUND:** Mug shifts in hand. Small ceramic clink.

**THE DONKEY**
*(nodding sagely)*
Tea.

*Beat. Five seconds of wind.*

**THE DONKEY**
You gonna drink it?

**THE MAN**
No.

**THE DONKEY**
Why'd you make it?

*Longer pause. A full eight seconds.*

**THE MAN**
Made coffee. Changed my mind.

**THE DONKEY**
So now it's tea.

**THE MAN**
It's cold.

The Donkey considers this. Accepts it with a small snort.

**SOUND:** Donkey snort. Wind picks up slightly.

---

**[1:32 - 1:42]**
**SHOT 2C - CLOSE-UP: THE DONKEY (10 seconds)**

Deadpan expression. Eyes half-lidded. The wisdom of the indifferent.

**SOUND:** Just wind. Chair creaks stop.

---

#### SCENE 3 - THE CHAIR

---

**[1:42 - 1:52]**
**SHOT 3A - WIDE: THE CHAIR SNAPS (10 seconds)**

The Man stands. The rocking chair, ancient and spiteful, makes a sound like a gunshot as it snaps beneath him. He freezes mid-motion. Wood splinters fall.

**SOUND:** Loud CRACK of wood. Echo. Silence. Wind returns slowly.

He looks down at the broken wood. Looks at the horizon.

---

**[1:52 - 2:18]**
**SHOT 3B - MID SHOT: THE WALK (26 seconds)**

The Man begins walking into the desert. No words. No hesitation. Just... leaves.

**SOUND:** Footsteps in sand. Slow, deliberate. Getting fainter.

The Donkey watches him go from the porch.

**THE DONKEY**
*(calling after, not urgent)*
You forgot your tea!

*The Man keeps walking. Shrinks. Disappears into heat waves.*

**SOUND:** Footsteps fade. Only wind remains.

---

**[2:18 - 2:37]**
**SHOT 3C - CLOSE-UP: THE DONKEY (19 seconds)**

The Donkey looks at the empty chair. Looks at the mug on the ground now. Settles back into the dirt, folding his legs beneath him.

**THE DONKEY**
*(to himself, content)*
Real nice day.

He closes his eyes. A small smile.

**SOUND:** Wind continues. Single guitar note. Peace.

---

**[2:37 - 2:45]**

**FADE TO BLACK**

**SOUND:** Wind fades. Silence. Then, very distant, the sound of the Man's footsteps still walking.

**END.**
