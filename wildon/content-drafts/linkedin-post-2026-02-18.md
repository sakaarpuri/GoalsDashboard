**HOOK:**

Your digital ad just got skipped. Again. 🤷

Meanwhile, our mobile billboards are getting 8-second average looks in traffic jams, parking lots, and event crowds.

The difference? One fights for attention. The other commands it.

**VALUE POINTS:**

🚚 **GO WHERE YOUR AUDIENCE IS**
Static billboards wait. Digital ad trucks hunt. We bring your message to high-traffic events, business districts, and neighborhoods where your ideal customers actually live, work, and play.

📊 **MEASURABLE IMPACT, NOT VANITY METRICS**
GPS tracking. Route analytics. Impression data. You get real numbers on where your ad traveled, how many eyes saw it, and what neighborhoods responded. No more guessing.

🎯 **EXPERIENTIAL THAT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCES**
Pair digital trucks with brand activations, sampling, or QR-driven experiences. We've turned street corners into pop-up showrooms—and passersby into qualified leads.

💰 **COST PER IMPRESSION THAT MAKES SENSE**
Compare CPMs with traditional OOH or saturated digital channels. Mobile billboards deliver premium visibility without the premium waste.
