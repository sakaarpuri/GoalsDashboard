## 🔥 THE HOOK

Your billboard is stuck in one place. Your audience isn't.

---

## 📊 VALUE POINTS

**1. Go Where Your Customers Actually Are**
Static billboards hope people drive by. Digital ad trucks GO to high-traffic events, business districts, and competitor locations. Targeting precision meets massive visibility.

**2. Cut Through the Digital Noise**
The average person sees 10,000+ digital ads daily—and ignores most of them. A 16ft LED truck rolling down Main Street? That's unskippable, unblockable, unforgettable.

**3. Real-Time Flexibility**
Change your message mid-campaign. A/B test creative. Respond to news, weather, or events instantly. Try doing THAT with a traditional billboard.

**4. Measurable ROI**
GPS tracking, impression estimates, photo/video proof of performance. Know exactly where your ad traveled and who saw it.
