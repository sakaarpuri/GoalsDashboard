🚚 HOOK:
Your ads are being ignored. Not because they're bad—but because they're exactly where everyone expects them to be.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: The average person sees 4,000+ digital ads daily. Banner blindness? Real. Scroll fatigue? Worse than ever. Meanwhile, the roads are wide open.

Digital ad trucks aren't just mobile billboards. They're unignorable.

📊 VALUE POINTS:

1. LOCATION AGILITY > STATIC PLACEMENT
Traditional OOH locks you into one spot for weeks. Digital ad trucks go where your audience actually is—downtown at lunch, stadiums on game day, events when crowds peak. Same spend, 10x the flexibility.

2. REAL-TIME CONTENT THAT POPS
Static billboards show one message. Our LED trucks rotate creatives, display live social feeds, even respond to weather or events. Rainy day? Your coffee ad hits different. Home team winning? Your brand rides that energy.

3. MEASURABLE IMPACT, NOT JUST IMPRESSIONS
GPS tracking. Route analytics. Engagement zones. You get data that matters—where your ad traveled, how long it stayed, which neighborhoods generated the most buzz. No more "hope it worked."

4. EXPERIENTIAL WITHOUT THE LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE
Pop-up activations are powerful but painful to execute. Digital ad trucks bring the experience to the street with zero venue permits, no setup crews, and immediate mobility. Big impact, small headache.
