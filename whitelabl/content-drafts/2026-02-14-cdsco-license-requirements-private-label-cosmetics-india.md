# CDSCO License Requirements for Private Label Cosmetics in India: The Complete 2026 Guide

Launching a private label cosmetics brand in India? Before you print those gorgeous labels or ship your first batch, there's a regulatory checkpoint you can't skip: **CDSCO compliance**.

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) under India's Ministry of Health & Family Welfare governs all cosmetic products manufactured, imported, or sold in India. Getting your licensing wrong can mean product seizures, hefty fines, or being shut out of the market entirely.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about CDSCO license requirements for private label cosmetics in 2026.

## What is CDSCO and Why Does It Matter?

**CDSCO** (Central Drugs Standard Control Organization) is India's national regulatory authority for:
- Pharmaceuticals
- Medical devices  
- **Cosmetics** (under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940)

For cosmetics, CDSCO ensures products meet safety standards, contain approved ingredients, and are properly labeled before reaching Indian consumers.

### Key Regulations Governing Cosmetics in India

| Regulation | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 | Defines cosmetics, sets licensing framework |
| Cosmetics Rules, 2020 | Updated rules for manufacturing, labeling, import |
| Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) | Quality standards for specific product categories |
| Legal Metrology Act, 2009 | Packaging, labeling, and weights regulations |

## Common Compliance Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Using Banned Ingredients
Always cross-check your formulation against the latest prohibited substances list.

### ❌ Incorrect Labeling
Missing MRP, manufacturing dates, or incomplete ingredient lists = product recall risk.

### ❌ Drug Claims
Claiming your cream "treats acne" makes it a drug requiring different (stricter) approval.

### ❌ Importing Without Registration
Shipments of unregistered cosmetics get seized at customs. Register first, import second.

### ❌ Ignoring State-Specific Rules
Some states have additional requirements beyond central CDSCO rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a separate license for each product?

**Import:** Form 42 registration is category-based. Similar products (e.g., all skincare) may be grouped.

### Can I sell cosmetics online without CDSCO registration?

No. All cosmetics sold in India — online or offline — must comply with CDSCO regulations. E-commerce platforms increasingly verify seller registrations.

### What's the penalty for selling unlicensed cosmetics?

Penalties include:
- Product seizure and destruction
- Fines up to ₹5 lakh or more
- Imprisonment up to 3 years for serious violations
- Business license cancellation

### Do handmade/natural cosmetics need CDSCO license?

Yes. "Natural" or "handmade" doesn't exempt you. If you're manufacturing cosmetics for sale, you need appropriate licensing.

### How often do I need to renew my license?

- Manufacturing (Form 32): Every 5 years
- Import Registration (Form 42): Every 3 years
- Start renewal process 6 months before expiry
