## The 7-Step Launch Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Niche

Don't try to be everything. Successful private label brands own a specific category:

| Niche | Market Gap | Example Positioning |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Clean/Minimalist | Chemical-free formulations | "10 ingredients or less" |
| Men's Grooming | Underserved male demographic | "Grooming for the modern Indian man" |
| Ayurvedic Fusion | Traditional + modern | "5000 years of beauty wisdom, clinically proven" |
| Budget Luxury | Premium feel, accessible price | "Luxury that doesn't break the bank" |
| Sustainable | Eco-conscious packaging | "Beauty without the footprint" |

**Action Item:** Pick ONE category to start. You can expand once you have traction.

### Step 2: Understand CDSCO Compliance

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) regulates cosmetics in India under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

**Cosmetics vs. Drugs: Know the Difference**

| Aspect | Cosmetic | Drug/Cosmeceutical |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Claims | "Cleanses," "Moisturizes," "Enhances" | "Treats," "Cures," "Reduces acne" |
| Registration | Not required for import/manufacture | Mandatory drug license |
| Timeline | 2-4 weeks for documentation | 3-6 months for approval |
| Cost | ₹15,000-30,000 | ₹50,000-1,50,000+ |

**CDSCO Requirements Checklist:**
- [ ] Product formula disclosure (but not full IP)
- [ ] Ingredient list with INCI names
- [ ] Safety assessment report
- [ ] Manufacturing license copy (from your supplier)
- [ ] Label artwork compliance check
- [ ] Free Sale Certificate (if importing)

**Pro Tip:** Work with a private label manufacturer who handles CDSCO documentation. At Whitelabl.in, we manage compliance as part of our service—saving you 40+ hours of paperwork.

### Step 3: Choose Your Product Mix

Start with 3-5 SKUs maximum. Here's the optimal starter portfolio:

**The "Hero SKU" Strategy:**
1. **Hero Product** (70% of marketing focus) — Your signature item
2. **Support Product** (20% focus) — Complements the hero
3. **Entry Product** (10% focus) — Low price point for acquisition

**High-Margin Starter Categories:**
- Face serums (65-75% margins)
- Lip tints and balms (60-70% margins)
- Hair oils with actives (55-65% margins)
- Body butters and scrubs (60-70% margins)

---

### Step 4: Find the Right Private Label Manufacturer

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- No CDSCO license or manufacturing certification
- Minimum order quantities above 500 units per SKU
- No formulation customization options
- Long lead times (>6 weeks for samples)
- No white-label design support

**Green Flags to Seek:**
- GMP-certified facility
- Existing library of 50+ proven formulations
- Low MOQ (100-300 units)
- Turnkey service: formula → packaging → labeling
- Transparent pricing with no hidden fees

---

### Step 5: Pricing Strategy That Works

**The 4X Rule:** Your retail price should be approximately 4x your landed cost.

**Example Pricing Breakdown:**

| Cost Component | Amount (₹) |
|----------------|-----------|
| Product cost (per unit) | ₹50 |
| Packaging & labeling | ₹25 |
| Shipping & logistics | ₹15 |
| **Landed cost** | **₹90** |
| Wholesale price (2x) | ₹180 |
| Retail price (4x) | ₹360 |

**Channel Strategy:**
- **Direct-to-Consumer (D2C):** Keep full margin, build customer relationships
- **Marketplaces (Amazon, Nykaa):** Expect 20-30% commission
- **Retail distribution:** Offer 40-50% margin to retailers

---

### Step 6: Brand Identity & Packaging

**India-Specific Packaging Considerations:**

1. **Heat Resistance:** Formulations must withstand 45°C+ transport conditions
2. **Monsoon Protection:** Humidity-resistant packaging for June-September
3. **Regulatory Labeling:**
   - MRP (Maximum Retail Price) in INR
   - Manufacturing license number
   - List of ingredients in descending order
   - Manufacturing and expiry dates
   - Net content in weight/volume

**Design Trends (2026):**
- Minimalist aesthetics with bold typography
- Regional language support (Hindi + English minimum)
- QR codes linking to ingredient transparency pages
- Recyclable/reusable packaging stories

---

### Step 7: Launch & Distribution

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Trademark registration (Class 3 for cosmetics)
- [ ] GST registration
- [ ] Brand social media handles secured
- [ ] 3-month content calendar ready
- [ ] Influencer seeding list (10-20 micro-influencers)
- [ ] Website with payment gateway

**Launch Channels Priority:**
1. **Instagram + WhatsApp Business** (highest ROI for Indian beauty)
2. **Amazon.in** (trust + reach)
3. **Nykaa** (beauty-focused audience)
4. **Your own D2C website** (highest margins)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping market research** — Test with 50-100 samples before full production
2. **Over-customizing initially** — Use proven formulations, focus on branding
3. **Ignoring compliance** — One CDSCO violation can shut down your business
4. **Underpricing** — You can't build a brand on unsustainable margins
5. **Spreading too thin** — Master one channel before expanding

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Research & niche selection | 1-2 weeks | Locked product category |
