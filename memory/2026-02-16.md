## Mission Control Dashboard Evolution

**Goal:** Create a task dashboard with draggable goals, schedule view, and AI activity tracking.

**Iterations:**
- v6-hybrid: First merge of draggable sidebar + clean task lists
- sharp: Dark minimalist aesthetic with JetBrains Mono, time slots
- collab: Added AI activity section, green gradient background
- v3-v5: Final polished version with clickable goals, short/long term tasks, calendar

**Key Features Delivered:**
- Left sidebar with 4 goals (Filmmaker, Whitelabl, WildOnMedia, YouTube) — draggable to reorder
- Day/Week/Month schedule toggle with priority-colored time slots
- AI Activity page showing what I'm working on + task history
- Small calendar widget on right panel
- Green gradient background with animated shine
- Quick-add tasks with author tags (You/AI)

**Final File:** `mission-control-v5.html` — all features working live

## Deployment Discussion

User asked about hosting options for live dashboard:
- **Option 1:** GitHub Pages (static, localStorage only)
- **Option 2:** VPS with SQLite (persistent, real-time, recommended)
- **Option 3:** Vercel + external DB (stateless, not ideal for real-time collab)

Decision: Paused — user will decide later on VPS setup.

## ShopperAgent Redesign

**Brief:** Update copy and UX to emphasize "AI that decides, not just recommends"

**Approach:**
- Quick entry: Style cards + budget/occasion pills (no body questions upfront)
- Demonstrate multi-retailer cart building (Nordstrom, SSENSE, Mr Porter, Everlane)
- Live-animated decision flow showing AI filtering 12,847 items
- One-click approve flow: AI builds cart → user approves → single checkout

**Visual Style:**
- Merged dark gradient aesthetic with floating particles
- Animated orbs in background
- Hover effects on style cards
- Progress bars during "AI building" phase

**Final File:** `shopperagent-final.html`

## User Preferences Noted

- Likes quick experiences: get users in fast, detailed questions later
- Wants to see the "AI working" visually (progress bars, step animations)
- Multi-retailer angle is important — differentiation from single-store shopping
- Green gradient aesthetic preferred for dashboard
- Values both functionality AND visual polish

## ShopperAgent Bug Fixes — Gender Selection & Password Gate

**Issue:** Gender selection options (Mens/Womens/Unisex) not clickable in Quick Shop modal, while Categories and other preferences worked fine.

**Root Cause:** Original `toggleGender()` function used `el.closest('#quickShopModal')` to detect which modal was active, but the HTML structure had the modal ID on a parent wrapper, not the `.modal` element itself. This caused the function to fail silently.

**Working Solution (`toggleCategory` pattern):**
```javascript
function toggleGender(el) {
    // Check which modal is open (simple, reliable)
    const inQuickShop = document.getElementById('quickShopModal').classList.contains('active');
    
    // Remove selected from all gender options
    document.querySelectorAll('.gender-option').forEach(btn => btn.classList.remove('selected'));
    
    // Add selected to clicked
    el.classList.add('selected');
    
    // Save to appropriate state
    if (inQuickShop) {
        quickShopPrefs.gender = el.dataset.gender;
    } else {
        userProfile.gender = el.dataset.gender;
    }
}
```

**Secondary Issue:** During iterative fixes, introduced JavaScript syntax error (orphaned `try` block without `catch`). This broke the entire app.js file, causing password gate to stop working entirely.

**Resolution:** Complete rewrite of app.js with validated syntax (Node.js `--check` verified). All functionality restored:
- Password gate: `shopper2026`
- Gender selection: working
- Category filtering: working  
- Cart loading: shows `-` and `$--` during generation

**Lesson:** Always validate JS syntax before deploying. Use `node --check file.js` to catch errors early.
