## Morning Deliverables
- ✅ Generated Whitelabl blog post: "How to Start a Private Label Cosmetics Brand in India" (1,100 words, SEO-optimized)
- ✅ Generated WildOnMedia LinkedIn post: OOH advertising with digital ad trucks
- ✅ Sent Fashion AI app proposal (StyleSync) as offline HTML

## New Project: StyleSync (Fashion AI App)
**Concept:** AI-powered fashion curator that scans retailer websites in real-time
**Key Features Discussed:**
- Photo upload / URL paste for style matching
- Real-time scraping (not static database)
- Unified cart across multiple retailers
- Budget filtering
- Occasion, body type, sustainability filters
- Complete outfit suggestions

**Technical Decisions:**
- Kimi 2.5 doesn't support image analysis
- ✅ **Selected: Open-source CLIP (free, runs locally)** for vision AI
- Manual tagging as fallback for MVP

## Active Goals
1. Filmmaker career — 35% complete
2. Whitelabl.in — 15% complete  
3. WildOnMedia — 25% complete
4. **ShopperAgent (formerly StyleAgent) — MVP COMPLETE + REDESIGNED v3**
   - Original: React frontend, Express backend, 3 retailer scrapers, CLIP AI
   - **Redesigned with tech-brand inspiration:**
     - Stats dashboard (14,237 items matched, 87% avg match)
     - Glassmorphism cards with subtle glow
     - Command palette (Cmd+K)
     - Large typography, clear hierarchy
   - **Renamed to ShopperAgent** — final name reflecting shopping focus
   - **Solid dark design** (not glassy), stylish aesthetic
   - **Key feature:** "Pick a Look, Get a Cart" — inspiration carousel where users select looks and agent builds cart
   - **Wardrobe sets** display multiple items together (not single products)
   - Main CTA moved above steps: "Let's create your wardrobe's order cart selected from various brands"
   - Hero text: "Your Personal Shopping Agent"
   - 4-step flow moved to bottom: Share Style → Agent Curates → You Approve → Agent Orders
   - Location: `/data/.openclaw/workspace/stylesync/frontend/shopperagent.html`
   - Total build time: ~5 hours with sub-agents
