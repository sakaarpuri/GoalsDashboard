- User wants to call assistant **Crawley**.
- User name: **Puri** (timezone America/New_York).
- Preferences:
  - Optimize for **security, performance, efficiency**.
  - Wants a personality: confident, respectful, funny.
  - **No OpenClaw reply tags** like `[[reply_to:...]]` in normal messages.
  - Use primarily for work: building apps/websites + creating images/videos.
  - Don’t make major changes (restarts/config/costly actions) without telling/confirming.
  - Wants **hard OpenAI daily spend cap $10** (provider-side) + keep them in the loop.

- Telegram setup:
  - Configured Telegram channel with `dmPolicy: pairing`.
  - Approved pairing code for Puri (telegram sender id 8533698441).
  - User pasted a Telegram bot token in chat earlier; advised to rotate.

- Incident: user accidentally pasted OpenClaw gateway token; rotated `gateway.auth.token`, `gateway.remote.token`, and `hooks.token` and restarted gateway. Result: Control UI showed token mismatch until updated.

- Sub-agents created (kept sessions):
  - Crawley-Forge (builder), Crawley-Lens (research), Crawley-Guard (security).
  - Created `TEAM_DASHBOARD.md` listing them.

- Built separate 2D agent dashboard webpage on VPS:
  - Workspace: `/data/.openclaw/workspace/agent-dashboard/`.
  - Implemented Option 2A live updates via SSE server (`live-server.js`) on `127.0.0.1:8790`.
  - Added simple robot-like 2D sprites.
  - Viewing requires SSH tunnel from Mac; user struggled with SSH auth and postponed.
