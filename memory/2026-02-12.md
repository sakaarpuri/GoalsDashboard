- User prefers short responses.
- Tone: friendly, smart, funny; avoid formality and repetition; don’t ask “need anything else?”.
- For PDFs: make them visually rich (design/graphics/infographics), not plain text dumps.
- When sending multiple topics, user prefers splitting into separate PDFs (if requested/appropriate).
- Sub-agents renamed preference: c-forge, c-lens, c-guard. Human nicknames: c-forge=Avi, c-lens=Mira (female), c-guard=Sid. (Neel is an acceptable alternate.)
- Wants weekly help growing OOH media business (wildonmedia.com), but it's not the only business.
- Image/video creation training (Nano Banana Pro, GPT image, etc.) is also for Puri’s general content creation/filmmaking for social media/YouTube.
- Plans to provide higgsfield.ai API later for image/video generation integration.
- Wants WordPress automation for blogs: drafts on an interval with approval required; will provide WP API/auth via env vars (not pasted in chat).
- Wants a no-scroll way to view outputs: created /data/.openclaw/workspace/reports/index.html gallery.
