## Key actions / state (reconstructed)
- User wants persistent recall of actions taken today; session transcript logs exist in `/data/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl` and can be read to reconstruct actions/decisions.
- ShopperAgent / WardrobeAI frontend: hero updated with ready-to-order carts (`quickBuy(...)`) and later replaced static hero visuals with an animated “AI capability demo” (3-stage: preferences → searching retailers → results with match scores). File path referenced: `/data/.openclaw/workspace/stylesync/frontend/index.html`.
- Mission Control dashboard: created at `/data/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control/index.html` and served by backend at `/dashboard` via Express static route.
- Moonshot/Kimi: user added Moonshot API key + base URL in Hostinger Docker UI to the OpenClaw container; we began wiring backend proxy endpoint for Moonshot (pending full verification due to env/model allowlist constraints).
- Hostinger/Docker networking: only one published port initially observed (59074→59074). Hostinger support requested switching mapping to 59075:80; container recreate/restart expected.
- ngrok links mentioned earlier (e.g., `https://huong-radiometric-luanna.ngrok-free.dev`) are ephemeral and can expire; currently returning ngrok 404 (ERR_NGROK_3200), so tunnels need restarting/config.
